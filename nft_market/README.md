# NFT Market Contract: NovaValult Marketplace ðŸ›’

The NFT Market Contract is a decentralized marketplace component of **NovaValult**. It enables users to list, offer, and purchase NFTs using a token-based payment system. Built with the Stylus SDK and targeting the Arbitrum network, this contract integrates with ERC-1155 and ERC-20 standards to ensure secure, transparent, and seamless NFT transactions.

## Overview ðŸš€

- **Purpose:**  
  This contract allows users to:
  - Offer their NFTs for sale by setting a price, sale status, and available quantity.
  - Retrieve sale details for multiple NFTs.
  - Purchase NFTs from other users while transferring funds securely.
  - Update and enforce marketplace rules through admin-controlled functions.

- **Key Standards:**  
  - **ERC-1155:** Used for NFT balance checks and safe transfers.
  - **ERC-20:** Utilized for transferring funds between buyers and sellers.

- **Core Components:**
  - **Sales Mapping:**  
    A double mapping that tracks sale details (price, sale state, available amount) for each NFT offered by a seller.
  - **Admin Control:**  
    An admin address is maintained to set up critical addresses (ERC-1155 and ERC-20 contracts) and enforce marketplace rules.
