## Overview 🚀
NovaVault transforms NFT valuation by adding a verified layer of trust and value. Instead of relying solely on creator reputation or social media presence, NFTs gain a **validated value** through community-based voting, token incentives, and immutable records. With integrated gallery management, token swaps, and detailed analytics, Nova Value creates an ecosystem where every participant benefits from the collective effort to recognize and reward digital art.

2. **erc1155 🖼️**  
   - **Role:** Implements the standard ERC1155 token where NFTs are ultimately minted, ensuring a flexible and efficient token standard.

3. **gallery contract 🏛️**  
   - **Role:** Hosts the core functionalities of each gallery, maintaining state and essential gallery information.

4. **minter 🔐**

5. **nft_libary 📚**
