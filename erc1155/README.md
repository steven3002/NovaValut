# ERC1155 Contract: novaValult NFTs and SFT ðŸŽ¨

This contract is a robust ERC1155 implementation designed for the novaValult platform. It manages both NFTs and Semi-Fungible Tokens (SFTs) with extended metadata capabilities and admin-controlled mintingâ€”all built on Arbitrum Stylus Rust.

---

## Overview ðŸš€

- **Collection Name:**  
  Defined by the `NovaParams` trait as `"Nova Vault NFTs and SFT"`.  
  *(Note: While the immutable name here is defined as "Nova Vault NFTs and SFT", the platform is branded as **novaValult**.)*

- **Purpose:**  
  This contract extends standard ERC1155 functionality to:
  - Handle multiple token types within a single contract.
  - Maintain detailed metadata linking each token to its gallery, system NFT ID, and additional metadata ID.
  - Securely mint tokens via designated admin and minter roles.
  - Facilitate safe transfers and batch operations with full event logging.

## Key Features âœ¨

1. **Multi-Token Management:**
   - **Balance Queries:**  
     - `balance_of(account, id)` returns the token balance for a specific ID.
     - `balance_of_batch(accounts, ids)` enables batch queries for multiple tokens.
   - **Operator Approvals:**  
     - `set_approval_for_all(operator, approved)` lets users delegate token management.
     - `is_approved_for_all(account, operator)` verifies delegated permissions.

2. **Secure Transfers:**
   - **Single Transfers:**  
     - `safe_transfer_from(from, to, id, amount, data)` securely moves tokens between addresses.
   - **Batch Transfers:**  
     - `safe_batch_transfer_from(from, to, ids, amounts, data)` handles multiple token transfers in one go.

3. **Minting & Supply Control:**
   - **Minting Functions:**  
     - `_mint(to, id, amount, data)` and `_mint_batch(to, ids, amounts, data)` allow the designated minter to create new tokens.
   - **Total Supply Tracking:**  
     - Maintains a mapping to track the total number of tokens for each token ID.

4. **Metadata Management:**
   - **Custom Data Storage:**  
     - Uses a `MetaData` struct to store the gallery ID, system NFT ID, and metadata ID for each token.
   - **Data Operations:**  
     - `setData(id, g_id, s_n_id, m_d_id)` assigns metadata to a token.
     - `getData(id)` retrieves metadata for verification and display.

5. **Admin Controls & Security:**
   - **Minter & Admin Roles:**  
     - Only the designated minter can mint tokens.
     - `set_minter(minter)` allows admin-controlled assignment of the minter address.
   - **Error Handling:**  
     - Custom errors (e.g., `InvalidParameter`) ensure robust failure management and transparency.

6. **Event Logging:**
   - **Transparency:**  
     - Events such as `TransferSingle`, `TransferBatch`, and `ApprovalForAll` log critical actions to the blockchain for auditing and debugging.
   - **URI Event (Commented):**  
     - An event for URI updates is in place for future metadata handling enhancements.

## Architecture & Components ðŸ”§

- **Storage Variables:**
  - **Balances:**  
    Maps token IDs to owner addresses and their balances.
  - **Operator Approvals:**  
    Maps account addresses to their approved operators.
  - **Total Supply:**  
    Keeps track of the total number of tokens for each token ID.
  - **Metadata Mapping:**  
    Associates each token ID with its metadata (gallery ID, system NFT ID, metadata ID).
  - **Minter & Admin:**  
    Addresses that control minting and admin functions, ensuring secure and controlled operations.

- **NovaParams Trait:**
  - Provides immutable parameters such as the collection name, ensuring consistency across the platform.

- **Error Management:**
  - Uses a defined `Erc1155Error` enum with custom errors to manage invalid operations or unauthorized access.

## Usage Guide ðŸ“š

### Querying Balances
```rust
let balance = erc1155_instance.balance_of(user_address, token_id);
let balances = erc1155_instance.balance_of_batch(vec![addr1, addr2], vec![token_id1, token_id2]);
```

### Managing Approvals
```rust
erc1155_instance.set_approval_for_all(operator_address, true);
let isApproved = erc1155_instance.is_approved_for_all(user_address, operator_address);
```

### Transferring Tokens
- **Single Transfer:**
  ```rust
  erc1155_instance.safe_transfer_from(from_address, to_address, token_id, amount, vec![])?;
  ```
- **Batch Transfer:**
  ```rust
  erc1155_instance.safe_batch_transfer_from(from_address, to_address, vec![token_id1, token_id2], vec![amount1, amount2], vec![])?;
  ```

### Minting Tokens (Admin Only)
- **Single Mint:**
  ```rust
  erc1155_instance._mint(recipient_address, token_id, amount, vec![])?;
  ```
- **Batch Mint:**
  ```rust
  erc1155_instance._mint_batch(recipient_address, vec![token_id1, token_id2], vec![amount1, amount2], vec![])?;
  ```

### Metadata Management
- **Setting Metadata:**
  ```rust
  erc1155_instance.setData(token_id, gallery_id, system_nft_id, metadata_id)?;
  ```
- **Getting Metadata:**
  ```rust
  let data = erc1155_instance.getData(token_id)?;
  ```

### Admin Functions
- **Setting the Minter:**
  ```rust
  erc1155_instance.set_minter(new_minter_address)?;
  ```
