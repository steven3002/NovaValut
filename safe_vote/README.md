# Safe Vote Contract: NovaValult Voting System üó≥Ô∏è

The Safe Vote Contract is an essential component of the **NovaValult** platform that manages secure, token-based voting for NFTs. It ensures that users can safely cast and increase their votes during the gallery‚Äôs voting period while enforcing eligibility, timing, and fund transfer checks. This contract interacts with several external contracts‚Äîsuch as the gallery, stake, ERC-20, and NFT Library contracts‚Äîto verify conditions and record votes securely.

---

## Overview üöÄ

- **Purpose:**  
  Enables users to cast votes on NFTs in a gallery by transferring tokens as bids. Votes are recorded safely, and users can also increase their previously cast bids. The contract guarantees that:
  - Users can only vote if they have a valid ticket for the gallery.
  - Votes can only be cast during the active voting period.
  - Bids meet the minimum requirements and are correctly transferred to the NFT creator.
  - Only authorized voters (and the vote owner) can update their bids.

- **Key Integrations:**  
  - **ERC-20 Contract:** Handles token transfers for bidding.
  - **Gallery Contract:** Provides gallery details (voting times, user ticket status).
  - **Stake Contract:** Manages vote recording and bid updates.
  - **NFT Library Contract:** Used to verify NFT creator details and vote ownership.

## Key Features ‚ú®

1. **Casting Votes Securely:**  
   - **Function:** `cast_vote`  
     Allows a user to cast a vote on an NFT by submitting a bid. The function:
     - Retrieves gallery voting information (start, end, and minimum bid).
     - Validates that the bid meets the minimum requirement.
     - Confirms that the user holds a valid ticket and has not already voted.
     - Checks that the vote is cast during the active voting period.
     - Transfers funds from the voter to the NFT creator.
     - Records the vote in the stake contract.

2. **Increasing a Vote:**  
   - **Function:** `increase_cast`  
     Enables a user to increase their bid on an already cast vote. The process:
     - Ensures the vote is being increased during the valid voting period.
     - Retrieves the current bid value and confirms the new bid is higher.
     - Transfers only the difference in bid value from the voter to the NFT creator.
     - Updates the bid amount in the stake contract.

3. **Admin Control & Configuration:**  
   - **Function:** `set_control`  
     Allows the admin to configure the essential contract addresses (stake, ERC-20, gallery, and NFT Library) to ensure all interactions are routed correctly.
   - **Admin Verification:**  
     Uses a check to lock the admin role and restricts sensitive functions to authorized users.

4. **Supporting Utility Functions:**  
   - **Gallery Information Retrieval:**  
     `get_gal_info` fetches voting start/end times and the minimum bid required.
   - **Ticket Verification:**  
     `c_tik` checks if a user holds a valid ticket for a gallery.
   - **Vote Ownership & Data:**  
     Functions like `get_creator` and `get_staking_data` ensure that the NFT exists and that only the owner of a vote can update their bid.
   - **Fund Transfer:**  
     `fund_tf` facilitates the secure transfer of tokens (ERC-20) from the voter to the NFT creator.

- **Workflow:**
  - **Admin Verification:**  
    Checks that the caller is the admin (or sets the admin if not already set).
